DoES Liverpool Log Cards
---

Script for operating the doors in DoES Liverpool.

When testing, set the environment variable `DOORBOT_TEST`:

    `DOORBOT_TEST=TEST`

This will create a named pipe at `/tmp/logcards-test.pipe` into which you can pipe UIDs to test the code, e.g.:

    `echo myuniqueid > /tmp/logcards-test.pipe`

More documentation on the system can be found on the DoES wiki:
